## üì¢ What is the servicebus-csharp-function-dataverse project?

It is a GitHub repository using the [**Azure Developer CLI**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/overview) to get you up and running on Azure quickly in a scenario where you need to process messages from an Azure Service Bus to a Dataverse environment through a C# Azure Functions app.

It contains components (GitHub workflows, infrastructure as code in Bicep, C# Azure Functions app code...) that will help you be up and running quickly.

## üìñ Documentation

### Prerequisites

The following prerequisites are required to use this application. Please ensure that you have them all installed locally.

- [Git (2.36.1+)](https://git-scm.com/)
- [GitHub CLI (v2.3+)](https://github.com/cli/cli)
- [Azure CLI (2.38.0+)](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)
- [Azure Developer CLI](https://aka.ms/azure-dev/install)
   - Windows:

```powershell
powershell -ex AllSigned -c "Invoke-RestMethod 'https://aka.ms/install-azd.ps1' | Invoke-Expression"
```

   - Linux/MacOS:

```powershell
curl -fsSL https://aka.ms/install-azd.sh | bash
```

- [.NET SDK 6.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/6.0)

### Quickstart

The fastest way for you to get this application up and running on Azure is to use the `azd up` command. This single command will create and configure all necessary Azure resources - including access policies and roles for your account and service-to-service communication with Managed Identities.

1. Open a terminal, create a new empty folder, and change into it.
1. Run the following command to initialize the project, provision Azure resources, and deploy the application code.

```powershell
azd up --template rpothin/servicebus-csharp-function-dataverse
```

You will be prompted for the following information:

- `Environment Name`: This will be used as a prefix for the resource group that will be created to hold all Azure resources. This name should be unique within your Azure subscription.
- `Azure Location`: The Azure location where your resources will be deployed.
- `Azure Subscription`: The Azure Subscription where your resources will be deployed.

> NOTE: This may take a while to complete as it executes three commands: `azd init` (initializes environment), `azd provision` (provisions Azure resources), and `azd deploy` (deploys application code). You will see a progress indicator as it provisions and deploys your application.

When `azd up` is complete it will output the following URLs:

- Azure Portal link to view resources
- ToDo Web application frontend
- ToDo API application
